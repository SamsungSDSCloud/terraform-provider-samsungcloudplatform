## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The block storage name to create. (3 to 28 characters with -)
- `storage_size_gb` (Number) The storage size(GB) of the block storage to create. (10 to  16384 GB)

### Optional

- `bm_server_ids` (List of String) Baremetal server IDs to which you want to assign the block storage.
- `encrypted` (Boolean) Encrypt the volume to be created and create it. When encryption is applied, performance degradation of around 10% occurs.
- `product_name` (String) You can use by selecting SSD or HDD based storage.
- `snap_shot_schedule` (Map of String) schedule for snapshot
- `snapshot_capacity_rate` (Number) snapshot capacity rate(100 ~ 500)
- `snapshot_policy` (Boolean) Use an additional 100-300% of the Block Storage capacity you created. If auto-creation is set, snapshots are created and saved automatically according to the specified cycle. You can restore using the saved snapshot.
- `tags` (Map of String)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
